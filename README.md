# Awesome Places

This is a humble list of places I've been to, thought were cool, and wanted to share with people! The lists themselves are in no particular order but I will do my best to sort them where possible.


# USA

## Missouri

### Columbia

- [VooDoo Sno-Balls](https://www.yelp.com/biz/voodoo-sno-columbia) (like a snow cone but better)
- [Skylark Bookshop](https://www.skylarkbookshop.com/)
